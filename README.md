2016 - I had to rename the two address columns to "address1" and
"address2"

2017 - removed these lines from the end of the sheet:

,,,,,,,,
Gray shading:,,Birds left at site or released,,,,,,
Yellow shading:,,Missing birds,,,,,,
Green shading:,,"Given to Genoscape Project, UCLA",,,,,,
Orange shading:,,"Given to National Zoo, Bird House",,,,,,
"Note: Some ID numbers have been removed because the birds were not eligible for listing (flew off; not in DC, fledglings, etc.)",,,,,,,,
Final:,360 birds,,,,,,,
